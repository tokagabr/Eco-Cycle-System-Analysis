# ♻️ Eco Cycle – Integrated Waste Management System
> **Technical System Analysis & Full-Stack Development**

## 📌 Project Overview
**Eco Cycle** is a sustainable business solution designed to tackle plastic pollution in Egypt. The platform connects partners (Universities, Malls, Hospitals) with a centralized recycling facility. It automates the lifecycle of plastic waste—from collection at smart drop-off points to processing it into raw materials for **3D printing filaments**.

## 🏗️ System Analysis & Design
*As a System Analyst on this project, I led the documentation and modeling phase to ensure a seamless integration between business logic and technical execution.*

### 1. Requirements Engineering
* **Functional:** User Authentication, Reward Points Calculation, Partner Dashboard, and Filament Inventory Management.
* **Non-Functional:** System Scalability, Data Integrity, and High Availability for partner transactions.

### 2. UML Modeling (The Core Logic)
The project includes detailed architectural diagrams to map the system's behavior:
| Diagram Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case Diagram** | Defined interactions between Users, Partners, and System Admins. |
| **Class Diagram** | Architected the database entities (Users, Orders, Inventory, PlasticTypes). |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Modeled the step-by-step logic for the "Reward Points" and "Checkout" flows. |
| **Activity Diagram** | Visualized the operational workflow from plastic collection to sorting. |
| **Context Diagram** | Defined the system boundaries and external entities. |
