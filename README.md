📝 Eco Cycle – Integrated Waste Management System
Technical System Analysis & Full-Stack Implementation
🌟 Overview
Eco Cycle is a sustainable startup solution designed to tackle plastic pollution. The platform connects partners (Universities, Malls, Supermarkets) with a centralized recycling system. It automates the process of collecting plastic waste, sorting it by quality, and transforming it into raw materials for 3D printing filaments.

🛠️ Tech Stack
System Analysis: UML Modeling (Draw.io), Requirements Engineering.

Front-End: React.js, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3.

Back-End: PHP (Server-side logic).

Database: MySQL (Relational Database Design).

📊 System Analysis & Design (The Core)
In this project, I performed a full SDLC analysis to ensure the system meets business and user needs.

1. Requirements Engineering
Functional Requirements: User registration, reward points system, partner location tracking, and an e-commerce checkout for recycled materials.

Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability for new partners, data security for transactions, and high availability.

2. UML Modeling
I designed multiple diagrams to map the system architecture:

Use Case Diagram: To define interactions between Users, Partners, and Admins.

Class Diagram: To architect the database entities (User, Order, PlasticType, Inventory).

Sequence Diagram: To model the logic of the "Reward Points" and "Order Placement" processes.

Activity Diagram: To visualize the plastic sorting and recycling workflow.

🚀 Key Features
Smart Collection Points: A dashboard to locate and manage drop-off boxes at partner sites.

Recycling Inventory: Real-time tracking of collected plastic vs. processed raw materials.

E-commerce Store: A functional shop for selling 3D printing materials produced from recycled waste.

Rewards Logic: A points-based system to incentivize partners and users to recycle more.
